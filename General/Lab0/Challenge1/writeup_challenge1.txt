Challenge 1

1 - Identify a user of interest.
2 - Identify the task that they perform.
3 - Start to ask questions pertaining to that task that would highlight potential problems.
4 - Look for answers to your questions (browse online, ask people who fall into the category of the person, etc.)
5 - Formulate the problem statement as best as you can based on the previous four steps.

1. Student 
2. Take notes

3. One problem that can arise from that is to not be able to write down efficiently what is being said by the professor. What can I do to not lose track of what is being said?  

4. One solution to this problem is to enable a transcript option but it is not always the case that the words gets transcribed perfectly. Most of the time, you are required to manually correct errors. 

5. The problem identified is: how can I get a better transcription of lectures ? One way to solve this issue would be to create a design that could correct and reorganize the transcript. In other words, an algorithm that could do so by making the transcript more readable.
