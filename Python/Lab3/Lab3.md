The objective of this lab was to learn how to communicate with the Arduino using python.

In tutorial_python_basics, we learned the basics of python. The tutorial focuses on how to deal with strings, lists and functions. 
In tutorial_pyserial, we learned how to communicate with the Arduino via Python and we also learned how to use
the option to send data via Bluetooth.

## Challenge 1
For Challenge1, we created 2 functions: one to translate from english to piglatin and another one to translate from piglatin to english.
We were asked to display the output of these 2 functions on the OLED by connecting Python with the Arduino.

##  Challenge 2
For Challenge2, we used open weather api to display temperature, current time, date and weather on the OLED. 
We had to display the information from a specific a location (I chose San Diego,CA,US).
We were asked to send the data from Python and to update the OLED in real-time via Bluetooth. 
To do this, I had to learn how to use the libraries : pyowm and datetime.
