The objective of this lab was to learn how to communicate with the Arduino using python

For tutorial_pyserial, we learned how to communicate with the Arduino via Python and we also learned how to use
the option to send data via Bluetooth.

## Challenge 1
For Challenge1, we created 2 functions: one to translate from english to piglatin and another one to translate from piglatin to english.
We were asked to display the output of these 2 functions on the OLED by connecting Python with the Arduino.

##  Challenge 2
For Challenge2, we used open weather api to display temperature, current time, date and weather on the OLED. 
We were asked to send the data from Python and to update the OLED in real-time via Bluetooth. 
To do this, I had to learn how to use the libraries : pyowm and datetime.
